``rpm-versiontracker`` is a small, generic, [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)
web application that leverages the
[DNF API](http://dnf.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html) to display the list
 of packages available from different repositories and compare them.

It provides a REST API to query itâ€™s settings and return package lists so you
can build and integrate around it.

``DNF`` is short for ``Dandified Yum``, the next generation of package
management for Red Hat based distributions.

Use case
========
The typical use case for this application is to monitor which version is in
which repository.

If you happen to have multiple mirrors for your packages (_ex: trunk, staging,
production_), this tool could be useful.

We have created this application to be able to easily distinguish versions of
the same packages across different repositories.

What it looks like
==================
This application is currently used for following package versions across
different Openstack repositories [here](http://versiontracker.dmsimard.com).

Documentation
=============
Documentation on the REST API, how to install, configure and run
``rpm-versiontracker`` is available on
[ReadTheDocs.org](http://rpm-versiontracker.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)
